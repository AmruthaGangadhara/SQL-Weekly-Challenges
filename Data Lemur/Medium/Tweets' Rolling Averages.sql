A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.

WITH cte as (SELECT user_id,tweet_date,AVG(tweet_count)
OVER(partition by USER_ID order by tweet_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets)
select user_id,tweet_date,ROUND(rolling_avg_3d,2) rolling_avg_3d
FROM CTE
