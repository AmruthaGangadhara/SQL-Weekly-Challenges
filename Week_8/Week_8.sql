+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution:

SELECT p.firstname,p.lastname,a.city,a.state --- used left join as the requirement was to output null for those with no address details
FROM person p LEFT JOIN address a on
p.personId=a.personId
