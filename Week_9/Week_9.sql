Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Solution:


SELECT email Email
FROM person
GROUP BY email
HAVING count(*)>1     --used having clause as I had to filter the output once the data was aggregated since i was looking for email with count more than 1

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.

Write an SQL query to report the first login date for each player.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

FROM Activity
GROUP BY 1  --MIN returns the earliest date

name is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

SELECT name,population,area
FROM world
WHERE area>=3000000 OR population>=25000000;
